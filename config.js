// IMPORTANT: no third-party API secrets live here. Deepgram, Gemini and Notion
// keys are stored server-side as Supabase Edge Function secrets (shared with the
// macOS app and the Winday CRM). The extension only knows the Supabase URL +
// publishable ("anon") key — both safe to ship, since access is gated by
// Supabase Auth + Row-Level Security.
//
// This points at the SAME Supabase project as the macOS Winday Notetaker and the
// Winday CRM ("WInday App"), so recordings, transcripts and notes land in the
// same database, the same account and the same Notion.
